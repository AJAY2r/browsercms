3.3.0
====

* All CMS static assets (js, images, html, etc) are now served directly from the browsercms.gem file. They are no longer
  copied into projects, and should make it much easier to keep track of whether a file has been altered/overridden.
  Any unaltered copied file can be safely deleted from any projects that upgrade to 3.3.
