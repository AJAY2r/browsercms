Currently fixing unit tests.
* Need to install developer tools to get mysql working.
* Dynamic Attributes are broken. (Portlets)
** May be because of overriding attributes= or some other internal ActiveRecord::Base API.
** Can we completely get rid of the need for this? It's a consistent source of problems.
* Transient attributes may not be passed to update_attributes (publish_on_save)
