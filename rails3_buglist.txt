Start with:

State of Test Cases - All Pass (As of Jan 21, 2011)

Todo List
===============
* Clean up logging messages that are filling up the production logs unnecessarily
** 'Caching enabled'
** 'Not the CMS site'
** 'Rendering content block X'
** 'Not caching, user logged in'
** Rendering template X'
* Have at most one line per request for any diagnostic result.

Open Issues
===========
* Saving a block with unchanged value shouldn't create additional versions. Currently saving an HtmlBlock results in 'changed_tags'.
* Will need to rewrite generators to use Thor (Will require new fork)

Known Bugs
==========
* Deleting routes does not appear to reload them (Does not appear to be Rails 3 related)

Module Testing
==============
* Test that FckEditor module works with file browser.xml works (WYSIWYG editor)

html_safe = A pain
=========
As of Jan 2011, pretty much every content_block's render.html.erb needs to stick html_safe on everything, which is both tedious and annoying.
Need to figure out a better way to globally handle this.

Good Ideas
* Rewrite Behaviors to use ActiveSupport::Concern (at least look at it to see what is useful)
* Not sure Publishing and Versioning should be split up. They are really intertwined in practice.
* Start introducing cucumber tests
* Look at how ActionSupport works with providing hooks

To Do List
==========
1. Build the gem and test it against a new rails 3 project.
2. Verify it works in 1.8.7
3. Determine if both Rails 2 and 3 can be supported in the same gem.

Other Notes
==========
1. Some versions of 1.8.7-p248 and later have random Segmentation Fault/Bus issues with databases. See

    * Segmentation Fault - http://busyprogrammer.wordpress.com/tag/bus-error/ Only 1.8.7 p249
