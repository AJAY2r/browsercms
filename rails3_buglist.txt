Open Issues
===========
* No route found for /  (Neither root nor match "/" seem to work)
* Need to add raw html to buttons. (root_folder, expand_button)
* link_to_function has been removed. Check All and uncheck all are currently broken.
* No such method callback for blocks during saving.



String Output
=============
* All string in Rails 3 have html_safe attribute. <%= will automatically escape any string not marked as 'html_safe'
    unless raw() is used. Helper methods that return html will by default return 'unsafe' string which get escaped.

To Do List
==========
1. Build the gem and test it against a new rails 3 project.
2. Verify it works in 1.8.7
3. Determine if both Rails 2 and 3 can be supported in the same gem.

Items Completed
===============
1. Hacked some helpers to not return unsafe strings. This needs to be really fixed.
2. Upgraded the 'stock' Rails files of BrowserCMS to use Rails 3.
3. Upgraded factory_girl to use a Rails 3/git based version
4. Added bundler configuration (this will need to be documented).

Other Notes
==========
1. Some versions of 1.8.7-p248 and later have random Segmentation Fault/Bus issues with databases. See

    * Segmentation Fault - http://busyprogrammer.wordpress.com/tag/bus-error/ Only 1.8.7 p249
