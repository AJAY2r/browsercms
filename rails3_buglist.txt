Open Issues
===========
* No route found for /  (Neither root nor match "/" seem to work)
* It appears no CMS pages work. (The 'catchall' route doesn't work)
* Pages do not render their status icon in the sitemap.
* link_to_function has been removed. Check All and uncheck all are currently broken (See ApplicationHelper)
* No such method 'callback' for blocks during saving. (Versioning.save line #121)

To Do List
==========
0. Install jeweler for 1.9.1 to get rid of warnings.
1. Build the gem and test it against a new rails 3 project.
2. Verify it works in 1.8.7
3. Determine if both Rails 2 and 3 can be supported in the same gem.

Current Task
===========
The 'catchall' route seems to split the path into an array. The content controller reassembles it. I have reversed this procedure.
Need to review the routing code/Yehuta's articles on this, as I think I'm making a mess of it.

Items Completed
===============
1. Hacked some helpers to not return unsafe strings. This needs to be really fixed.
2. Upgraded the 'stock' Rails files of BrowserCMS to use Rails 3.
3. Upgraded factory_girl to use a Rails 3/git based version
4. Added bundler configuration (this will need to be documented).
5. Sitemap folders now render correctly (fixed raw/h strings issue). Buttons too.
6. Removed calls to 'after_validation_on_update' in favor of 'after_validation' with a check for new_record?

Other Notes
==========
1. Some versions of 1.8.7-p248 and later have random Segmentation Fault/Bus issues with databases. See
