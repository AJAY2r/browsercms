Start with:

    Date Formatting
    JQuery upgrade

    Further Help:
        - Add deprecation warnings to add_to_rails_path
        - Add deprecation warnings to add_generator_paths


Open Issues
===========
* Errors Bug: See below
* BUG: Jeweler seems to explictly add dependencies on MySQL just because the project is using them. Need to remove those.
* BUG: Core CMS is packaging too many generators under improper names
* BUG: Date formating isn't working (with BcmsNews). Date formating is going in at MM/dd/yyyy but being stored as YYYY-dd-MM (i.e. 2/7/2011 gets stored as 2011-7-2). Might be core bug.
* BUG: Date formatting for date_picker prints the full time stamp rather than m/d/yyyy
* Make a generator that just copies files from CMS gems into project. (cms:extract_gems). Then run that generator from cms:blank_site and cms:demo_site
* Entire 'db' directory is getting copied from core project, including .sqlite dbs. Need to tightend up or change generator
* Verify the v3.1 to v3.3 migration path.
* Rename to cms:upgrade rather than browser_cms:cms
* Merge all existing migrations into core as well as seeds.rb. Rework how seeds gets run as part of the project. (Future proof this).
* Test module scripts for new projects.
* test/dummy has some duplication ( migrations, seed.rb)
* Generators: These appear to be almost identical to how application templates worked. We should probably rewrite app templates to use new generators instead.

Gems to Publish (once its live)
=====
bcms_fckeditor  - 1.1.0 is pushed to github. Gem needs to be pushed as well.
bcms_news - 1.2 pushed to github. Gem not released yet.
bcms_google_mini_search - 1.2 pushed to github. Gem not released.

Future Features
===============
* Reduce need to developers to modify content-like files on server (CSS, JS, Images, Templates)
** Confirm w/ developers on what is commonly touched.
** Step 1: Make templates start on file system, appear in UI and then be 'forked' in UI. Avoids need to 'copy' into CMS and delete.
** Look at WebDAV / HTTPS protocol.
* What is the difference between application template and profiles?


Known Bugs
==========
* Deleting routes does not appear to reload them (Does not appear to be Rails 3 related)
* Saving a block with unchanged value shouldn't create additional versions. Currently saving an HtmlBlock results in 'changed_tags'.

Module Testing
==============
* Test that FckEditor module works with file browser.xml works (WYSIWYG editor)

html_safe = A pain
=========
As of Jan 2011, pretty much every content_block's render.html.erb needs to stick html_safe on everything, which is both tedious and annoying.
Need to figure out a better way to globally handle this.

Good Ideas
* Rewrite Behaviors to use ActiveSupport::Concern (at least look at it to see what is useful)
* Not sure Publishing and Versioning should be split up. They are really intertwined in practice.
* Look at how ActionSupport works with providing hooks

Wish List
===============
* Namespace core files (especially users) to better support dropping in as project.
* Allow Content Blocks to be namespaced.
* Clean up logging messages that are filling up the production logs unnecessarily
** 'Caching enabled'
** 'Not the CMS site'
** 'Rendering content block X'
** 'Not caching, user logged in'
** Rendering template X'
* Have at most one line per request for any diagnostic result.
* Verify it works in 1.8.7
* Determine if both Rails 2 and 3 can be supported in the same gem.  (Probably not)

Other Notes
==========
1. Some versions of 1.8.7-p248 and later have random Segmentation Fault/Bus issues with databases. See
    * http://busyprogrammer.wordpress.com/tag/bus-error/
    * Segmentation Fault - http://busyprogrammer.wordpress.com/tag/bus-error/ Only 1.8.7 p249
