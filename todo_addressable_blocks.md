Task: As an editor, I should be able to create events, products, etc, and have them be accessible at a given path.

* Put slug on section_nodes table.
* View blocks as page should include page toolbar
* Test behavior for other blocks
* Merge #show and #view_as_page
* Select a template to view a content type. Use the same template for each instance.
* Generate a new section when adding the first item of content (rather than as a seed)

## Nice to haves

* Autosuggest slugs based on name.
* Automatically insert :path field after name (avoid manual insertion). Use javascript to insert this once a user starts typing into Name field.
